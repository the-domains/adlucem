# Practical details 

**When**? 

The first game will take place on a Saturday; more specifically January 14th, 2017\. The next games will follow in fairly close succession, approximately 6 months apart. 

**Where**? 

The first game will be played at Oittaa mansion in Espoo. The games will most likely all be played in the southern Finland area. 

**What**? 

Our goals are to create an experience that is immersive, offers a chance for all players to play a key role, puts some demands on each individual player, and ultimately feels rewarding. 

This is a game that takes place in a modified historical time, where the genders are largely equal in every way. Ad Lucem is intended to be a game of mystery and intrigue for a mature audience, one of our goals is to give all players a chance to truly feel the atmosphere of the setting, and all characters to have a chance to strongly impact the game's outcome. 

The campaign will contain three (3) games, or "chapters". Between these games there may be some interaction and game-related activity. 

**Who**? 

This campaign is for approximately 35 players, possibly a few more during the progression of the campaign, if necessary. 

We expect proficiency in the English language, both spoken and written, and an enthusiasm to put a little effort into absorbing information vital to bringing your character to life. 

**How much**? 

The game fee for chapter 1 will be 75â‚¬/person (but you can pay this in two equal payments!). This covers props & extras, possible special effects, great food, wonderful venue and other, minor costs. Any budget surplus will be used towards the next game, and we will gladly provide you with an itemization of our budget, if you wish it. 

**How do I sign-up?**
