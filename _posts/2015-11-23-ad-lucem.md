**Ad Lucem** is an internationally open LARP campaign set in the year 1900, in Victorian England, and in a world that is eerily similar to our own. It is in the middle of an occult revival, it is on the brink of change and there is an energy born from the freshly dawned, new century in the air. 

You will play characters that, in a small way, have seen through the illusion that gives "normal" people a sense of security and warmth. With this realization comes power.
Most, if not all player characters will be some sort of experts in their own fields, with an avid interest in the unknown. The themes of this campaign revolve around **horror**, **occultism** and **The awakening.**
