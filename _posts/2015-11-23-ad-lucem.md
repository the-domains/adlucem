Ad Lucem is a LARP campaign set in the year 1900, in Victorian England, and in a world that is eerily similar to our own. It is in the middle of an occult revival, it is on the brink of change and there is an energy born from the freshly dawned, new century in the air.

Our players are characters that, in a small way, have seen through the illusion that gives "normal" people a sense of security and warmth. With this realization comes power, and the knowledge that the greater

the sacrifice, the greater the power you can gain from it.

Most that have seen through the illusion, or veil, have done so, for example, in moments of madness, ecstasy, dark occult rituals or the horrors of war. Most, if not all player characters will be some sort of experts in their own fields, with an avid interest in the unknown. The themes of this game series revolve around horror, occultism and The awakening.

Our goals are to create an experience that is immersive, offers a chance for all players to play a key role, puts demands on each individual player, and ultimately feels rewarding.

Secondly - We (Ines and Kai) are not able to do all of this on our own, so we will be looking for help to run and develop this game series. From putting it all together, down to the logistics, practical implementation, special effects and NPC roles (we got some really wicked ideas for NPCs).
